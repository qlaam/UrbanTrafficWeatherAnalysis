Factor 1: Atmospheric Stability Factor
This factor is mainly influenced by air pressure (loading = 0.41) and to a lesser extent by visibility.
It reflects variations in atmospheric stability but has weak influence from other weather variables.

Factor 2: Traffic Flow Stress Factor
This factor loads primarily on vehicle_count (0.33), representing traffic flow levels.
Other variables have very weak contributions, indicating that traffic measures are almost independent of weather conditions in this dataset.

Factor 3: Weather Severity Factor
This factor has moderate loading from air pressure (0.31) and weak negative loadings from humidity and wind speed.
It may represent a composite measure of weather severity, but its influence on traffic variables is minimal.

Weather–Traffic Relationship:
Based on the loadings:
No meaningful weather variable shows strong correlation with traffic flow or accident count. because the data is independent and synthetic. 
but air_pressure_hpa 0.412299 has the highest influence on traffic
