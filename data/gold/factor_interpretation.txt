Factor 1: Accident Risk Factor
This factor is strongly dominated by accident_count, with an extremely high loading,
indicating that it represents the overall risk of traffic accidents.
Other weather-related variables contribute only marginally, suggesting that this factor
captures accident occurrence as an independent latent construct.

Factor 2: Atmospheric Conditions Factor
This factor loads primarily on air_pressure_hpa, with secondary contributions from
visibility and temperature. It reflects general atmospheric and weather conditions
that describe the state of the environment rather than direct traffic dynamics.

Factor 3: Weather Severity Factor
This factor is mainly influenced by wind_speed_kmh and visibility, representing
weather severity and variability that can affect driving conditions.
Although its direct influence on traffic variables is limited, it captures
environmental stress caused by adverse weather conditions.

Weather–Traffic Relationship:
The analysis suggests that accident risk emerges as a distinct latent factor,
largely independent of traffic flow variables.
Among weather variables, air_pressure_hpa shows the strongest contribution within
the atmospheric conditions factor, indicating it as the most influential weather
feature in the dataset.
